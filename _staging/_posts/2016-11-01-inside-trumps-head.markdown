# Inside Trump's Head
_late 2016_


[JauntVR](https://www.jauntvr.com/title/86827a514e)

[Boom Chicago](http://www.boomchicago.nl)

A VR comedy piece showing a day in the life of virtual president Donald Trump.
Written and performed by Boom Chicago, directed by Steye Hallema and produced by JauntVR.
<br/><br/>
This project had an extreme tight turnaround, with only a week between the day of the shoot
and the post-production deadline.
On top of that, the entire production was done with a very small team, requiring everybody
to be flexible and assume multiple roles.

my role: 360Ëš DOP, Camera Operator, Data Handling, Editing, Compositing

tools: Jaunt ONE VR Camera, Jaunt toolchain, Adobe CC suite, Hackintosh Render Beast, Steye's crazy 3-wheeled longboard

crew: Steye Hallema, Mark van de Korput, Henk Spook
