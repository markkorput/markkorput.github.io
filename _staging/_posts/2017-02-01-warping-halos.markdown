# Warping Halos
_early 2017_

[Children of the Light](http://www.children-of-the-light.com/)

[Warping Halos Live @ STRP 2017](https://strp.nl/en/portfolio/warping-halos-live/)


For Warping Halos, Christopher and Arnout from Children of the Light were taking their previous work, [DIAPOSITIVE](https://vimeo.com/151759417), to the next level by introducing color and adding more dimensions to the installation. This made  the work, which plays with the way light interacts with the environment, even more complex and increased the gap between the (existing) design tools and the final result.

To aid in the design process I developed a software application with a virtual replica of the Halo that simulates with reasonable accuracy what the created animations will look like when coming from the installation. The application takes exactly the same input as the real installation, thus seamlessly fitting into the existing design process and requiring minimal effort to be used.

The application helps Children of the Light to better design content for the Warping Halos installation and to be less dependent on the physical installation. This was useful both when the physical installation was still under construction as well as whenever the installation is not available, like on the road, at home or in the backstage.
